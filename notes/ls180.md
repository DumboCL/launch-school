1. Database
   1. A basic definition of a database is simply 'a structured set of data held in a computer'
   2. RDBMS - Relational Database Management System. A software application for managing relational databases, such as PostgreSQL.
   3. Relational Database - A structured collection of data that follows the relational model.
   4. A **relation** is *usually* another way to say "table".
   5. A **relationship** is an association between the data stored in those relations.
   
2. Levels of Schema

   1. Conceptual Schema
      1. high-level design focused on identifying entities and their relationships
   2. Logical
      1. The Logical Schema is often containing a list of all the attributes and their data types but it isn't specific to an actual database. So if you are going to create a logical schema you might stick to the SQL standard column types as opposed to using the ones that are specific to any of the actual databases. It is between conceptual and physical schemas, it has more details than the conceptual and is concerned with implementation in a database just not a specific database.
   3. Physical Schema
      1. low-level database-specific design focused on implementation
   4. Cardinality
      1. Cardinality is the number of objects on each side of the relationship (1:1, 1:M, M:M)
   5. Modality
      1. The *modality* of a relationship indicates if that relationship is required or not.
      2. if the relationship is required (1) or optional (0)

3. SQL
   1. Definition
      1. **SQL** is a language used to manipulate the structure and values of datasets stored in a relational database.
      2. Structured Query Language. The language used by RDBMSs.
      3. SQL is predominantly a **declarative language**. This means that it describes *what* needs to be done, but does not detail *how* to accomplish this objective.
   2. Terms
      1. SQL Statement - A SQL command used to access/use the database or the data within that database via the SQL language.
      2. SQL query - A subset of a 'SQL Statement'. A query is a way to search, or lookup data within a database, as opposed to updating or changing data.
   3. Sub-Languages
      1. **DDL: Data Definition Language**. Used to define the structure of a database and the tables and columns within it.
      2. **DML: Data Manipulation Language**. Used to retrieve or modify data stored in a database. `SELECT` queries are part of DML.
      3. **DCL: Data Control Language**. Used to determine what various users are allowed to do when interacting with a database.

         2. `\connect` or `\c`
      4. table
         1. `\dt` - shows the tables in the current database
         2. `\d users` - shows the schema of the table users
         3. `\di` list all the index
      5. `\?`
      6. `\h`
         1. `\h DELETE`
      7. `\i`
         1. my_database=# \i ~/some/files/file_to_import.sql
      8. \COPY <table name> FROM 'location + file_name' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

7. Normalization
   1. The *reason* for normalization is to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity
   2. The *mechanism* for carrying out normalization is arranging data in multiple tables and defining relationships between them
   3. **Normalization** is the process of designing schema that minimize or eliminate the possible occurrence of these anomalies. The basic procedure of normalization involves extracting data into additional tables and using foreign keys to tie it back to its associated data.
   4. Three anomalies
      1. ![img](https://da77jsbdz4r05.cloudfront.net/images/one_to_many/step2.png)
      2. Update anomaly
         1. If a contact's name or phone number needs to be changed, we'd need to update every row that contained information about that contact. This creates a situation where it would be easy to make the database inconsistent, which means that it contains more than one answer for a given question. If this occurred, it would be known as an **update anomaly**.
      3. Insertion anomaly
         1. We can't store the information for a contact without having placed a call to them. This is known as an **insertion anomaly**.
      4. Deletion anomaly
         1. Likewise, we lose all the information about a contact if we delete the history of calls to them. This is known as a **deletion anomaly**.

8. Keys

   1. Natural Keys

      1. A **natural key** is an existing value in a dataset that can be used to uniquely identify each row of data in that dataset.

   2. Surrogate Keys

      1. A **surrogate key** is a value that is created solely for the purpose of identifying a row of data in a database table. Because it is created specifically for that purpose, it can avoid many of the problems associated with natural keys.

      2. Primary Keys - **A Primary Key is a unique identifier for a row of data**.
         1. ALTER TABLE users ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
         2. CREATE TABLE continents ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, continent_name varchar(50) );
         3. ALTER TABLE films ADD COLUMN id serial PRIMARY KEY;
         4. ALTER TABLE films DROP CONSTRAINT films_pkey;

      3. Foreign Keys - A Foreign Key allows us to associate a row in one table to a row in another table. This is done by setting a column in one table as a Foreign Key and having that column reference another table's Primary Key column.
         1. FOREIGN KEY (fk_col_name)
            REFERENCES target_table_name (pk_col_name);
            
         2. ALTER TABLE table_name
                  ADD FOREIGN KEY (column_name)
                  REFERENCES other_table(other_table_primary_key);

         3. CREATE TABLE orders (
                id serial PRIMARY KEY,
                product_id integer REFERENCES products (id),
                quantity integer NOT NULL
              );

         4. ALTER TABLE planets
              ADD COLUMN star_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES stars (id);

         5. ALTER TABLE books_categories  

              DROP CONSTRAINT "books_categories_book_id_fkey",  

              ADD CONSTRAINT "books_categories_book_id_fkey"  

              FOREIGN KEY ("book_id")  

              REFERENCES books(id)  

              ON DELETE CASCADE;

9. Referential Integrity

   1. One-to-One

      1. /*
         one-to-one: User has one address
         */

         CREATE TABLE addresses (
           user_id int, -- Both a primary and foreign key
           street varchar(30) NOT NULL,
           city varchar(30) NOT NULL,
           state varchar(30) NOT NULL,
           PRIMARY KEY (user_id),
           FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
               REFERENCES users (id)
               ON DELETE CASCADE
         );

      2. CASCADE / SET NULL / SET DEFAULT

      3. ON DELETE

         1. Adding this clause, and setting it to `CASCADE` basically means that if the row being referenced is deleted, the row referencing it is also deleted.

   2. One-to-Many

      1. CREATE TABLE books (
           id serial,
           title varchar(100) NOT NULL,
           author varchar(100) NOT NULL,
           published_date timestamp NOT NULL,
           isbn char(12),
           PRIMARY KEY (id),
           UNIQUE (isbn)
         );

         /*
          one-to-many: Book has many reviews
         */

         CREATE TABLE reviews (
           id serial,
           book_id integer NOT NULL,
           reviewer_name varchar(255),
           content varchar(255),
           rating integer,
           published_date timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
           PRIMARY KEY (id),
           FOREIGN KEY (book_id)
               REFERENCES books(id)
               ON DELETE CASCADE
         );

   3. Many-to-Many

      1. CREATE TABLE checkouts (
           id serial,
           user_id int NOT NULL,
           book_id int NOT NULL,
           checkout_date timestamp,
           return_date timestamp,
           PRIMARY KEY (id),
           FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
                                 ON DELETE CASCADE,
           FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
                                 ON DELETE CASCADE
         );
      2. SELECT books.id, books.author, string_agg(categories.name, ', ') AS categories
           FROM books
             INNER JOIN books_categories ON books.id = books_categories.book_id
             INNER JOIN categories ON books_categories.category_id = categories.id
           GROUP BY books.id ORDER BY books.id;

10. SQL Join

             1. SELECT table_nameN.column_name, ...
                       FROM table_name1
                       join_type JOIN table_name2
                                 ON join_condition;
             2. INNER JOIN - Combines rows from two tables whenever the join condition is met.
                1. SELECT users.full_name, books.title,
                          checkouts.checkout_date
                       FROM users
                       INNER JOIN checkouts
                             ON users.id = checkouts.user_id
                       INNER JOIN books
                             ON books.id = checkouts.book_id;
                2. ![image-20210817151943141](/Users/zz/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20210817151943141.png)
             3. LEFT JOIN - Same as an inner join, except rows from the first table are added to the join table, regardless of the evaluation of the join condition.
                1. A LEFT JOIN or a LEFT OUTER JOIN takes all the rows from one table, defined as the `LEFT` table, and joins it with a second table.
             4. RIGHT JOIN - Same as an inner join, except rows from the second table are added to the join table, regardless of the evaluation of the join condition.
                1. A `RIGHT JOIN` is similar to a `LEFT JOIN` except that the roles between the two tables are reversed, and all the rows on the second table are included along with any matching rows from the first table.
             5. ![image-20210817151408308](/Users/zz/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20210817151408308.png)
             6. FULL JOIN - A combination of left join and right join.
                   1. select c.id, c.name, c.payment_token, s.id, s.description, s.price 
                         from customers as c 
                         full join customers_services as cs 
                         on c.id = cs.customer_id 
                         full join services as s
                         on cs.service_id = s.id
                         where cs.service_id is null or cs.customer_id is null;
                   2. ![image-20210823221616007](/Users/zz/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20210823221616007.png)
             7. CROSS JOIN - Doesn't use a join condition. The join table is the result of matching every row from the first table with the second table, the cross product of all rows across both tables.
                1. A `CROSS JOIN`, also known as a Cartesian JOIN, returns all rows from one table crossed with every row from the second table. In other words, the join table of a cross join contains every possible combination of rows from the tables that have been joined.
                2. ![image-20210817151704617](/Users/zz/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20210817151704617.png)
                3. `SELECT * FROM comments CROSS JOIN users;`
                4. the above is as same as: `SELECT * from comments, users;`
             8. Multiple Join
                   1. A third and fourth `JOIN` acts in the same way -- each works with the previous virtual table and adds data from matching rows in the `JOIN` tables.

   11. Aliasing
          1. SELECT u.full_name, b.title, c.checkout_date
                    FROM users AS u
                    INNER JOIN checkouts AS c
                        ON u.id = c.user_id
                    INNER JOIN books AS b
                        ON b.id = c.book_id;

   12. SELECT count(id) AS "Number of Books Checked Out"
                FROM checkouts;

   13. Subqueries
             1. SELECT u.full_name FROM users u
                       WHERE u.id NOT IN (
                           SELECT c.user_id FROM checkouts c
                       );
                2. JOINs are faster to run than subqueries.
                3. EXISTS
                            1. SELECT 1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT id FROM books WHERE isbn = '9780316005388');
                            2. SELECT name FROM bidders
                                  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bids WHERE bids.bidder_id = bidders.id);
             4. IN
                      1. SELECT name FROM authors WHERE id IN (SELECT author_id FROM books WHERE title LIKE 'The%');
                      2. SELECT name AS "Bid on Items" FROM items
                            WHERE items.id IN (SELECT DISTINCT item_id FROM bids);
             5. NOT IN
                      1. SELECT name FROM authors WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT author_id FROM books WHERE title LIKE 'The%');
             6. ANY / SOME
                      1. SELECT name FROM authors WHERE length(name) > ANY (SELECT length(title) FROM books WHERE title LIKE 'The%');
             7. SELECT MAX(bid_counts.count) FROM
                     (SELECT COUNT(bidder_id) FROM bids GROUP BY bidder_id) AS bid_counts;
             8. SELECT name, (SELECT max(pop) FROM cities WHERE cities.state = states.name)
                       FROM states;
             9. select items.name, (select count(bids.id) from bids where bids.item_id = items.id) from items;
             10. SELECT id FROM items
                    WHERE ROW('Painting', 100.00, 250.00) =
                      ROW(name, initial_price, sales_price);

14. Sequence

       1. A **sequence** is a special kind of relation that generates a series of numbers. A sequence will remember the last number it generated, so it will generate numbers in a predetermined sequence automatically.

       2. -- This statement:

             CREATE TABLE colors (id serial, name text);

             -- is actually interpreted as if it were this one:

             CREATE SEQUENCE colors_id_seq;

             CREATE TABLE colors (

             id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('colors_id_seq'),

             name text

             );

       3. SELECT nextval('colors_id_seq');
       4. CREATE SEQUENCE counter;

       5. SELECT nextval('counter');

       6. DROP SEQUENCE counter;

       7. CREATE SEQUENCE even_counter INCREMENT BY 2 MINVALUE 2;

15. Index

          1. CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (field_name);
          2. CREATE INDEX ON books (author_id);
          3. CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (field_name_1, field_name_2);
                1. CREATE INDEX ON bids (bidder_id, item_id);
          4. DROP INDEX index_name

16. Assess a Query

          1. EXPLAIN
          2. ANALYZE

17. More Examples

          1. SELECT round( COUNT(DISTINCT tickets.customer_id)
                         / COUNT(DISTINCT customers.id)::decimal * 100,
                         2)
                    AS percent
               FROM customers
               LEFT OUTER JOIN tickets
                 ON tickets.customer_id = customers.id;
          2. SELECT customers.id, customers.email, COUNT(DISTINCT tickets.event_id)
               FROM customers
               INNER JOIN tickets
                 on tickets.customer_id = customers.id
               GROUP BY customers.id
               HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT tickets.event_id) = 3;
          3. SELECT events.name AS event,
                    events.starts_at,
                    sections.name AS section,
                    seats.row,
                    seats.number AS seat
               FROM tickets
               INNER JOIN events
                 ON tickets.event_id = events.id
               INNER JOIN customers
                 ON tickets.customer_id = customers.id
               INNER JOIN seats
                 ON tickets.seat_id = seats.id
               INNER JOIN sections
                 ON seats.section_id = sections.id
               WHERE customers.email = 'gennaro.rath@mcdermott.co';
          4. INSERT INTO calls ("when", duration, contact_id) VALUES ('2016-01-18 14:47:00', 632, 6);
