1. closure

   1. A closure is a general programming concept that allows programmers to save a "chunk of code" and execute it at a later time.
   2. It's called a "closure" because it's said to bind its surrounding artifacts (ie, variables, methods, objects, etc) and build an "enclosure" around everything so that they can be referenced when the closure is later executed.
   3. It is not defined with an explicit name
   4. The only thing to remember is that this "chunk of code" retains references to its surrounding artifacts -- its **binding**.
      1. A closure retains access to variables, constants, and methods that were in scope at the time and location you created the closure. It binds some code with the in-scope items.
   5. There are three main ways to work with closures in Ruby. Namely, in Ruby, a closure is implemented through a `Proc` object, a `lambda`, or a `block`.
      1. Instantiating an object from the Proc class
      2. Using **lambdas**
      3. Using **blocks**

2. blocks

   1. In other words, our familiar method, `[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }`, is actually *passing in* the block of code to the Array#each method
   2. blocks are just another argument being passed in to a method at method invocation time
   3. blocks can take arguments, just like normal methods. But unlike normal methods, it won't complain about wrong number of arguments passed to it.
   4. Blocks are a form of Proc

3. yield

   2. The yield keyword executes the block.

   2. If a method implementation has a `yield` in it somewhere, but we didn't include a block at method invocation, Ruby will raise `LocalJumpError` error.

   3. yield without argument

      ```ruby
      # method implementation
      def say(words)
        yield if block_given?
        puts "> " + words
      end
      
      # method invocation
      say("hi there") do
        system 'clear'
      end                                                # clears screen first, then outputs "> hi there"
      ```

      - Execution starts at method invocation, on line 8. The say method is invoked with two arguments: a string and a block (the block is an implicit parameter and not part of the method definition).
      - Execution goes to line 2, where the method local variable words is assigned the string "hi there". The block is passed in implicitly, without being assigned to a variable.
      - Execution continues into the first line of the method implementation, line 3, which immediately yields to the block.
      - The block, line 9, is now executed, which clears the screen.
      - After the block is done executing, execution continues in the method implementation on line 4. Executing line 4 results in output being displayed.
      - The method ends, which means the last expression's value is returned by this method. The last expression in the method invokes the puts method, so the return value for the method is nil.

   4. yield with an argument

      ```ruby
      # method implementation
      def increment(number)
        if block_given?
          yield(number + 1)
        end
        number + 1
      end
      
      # method invocation
      increment(5) do |num|
        puts num
      end
      ```

      - Execution starts at method invocation on line 10.
      - Execution moves to the method implementation on line 2, which sets 5 to the local variable number, **and the block is not set to any variable; it's just implicitly available.**
      - Execution continues on line 3, which is a conditional.
      - Our method invocation has indeed passed in a block, so the conditional is true, moving execution to line 4.
      - On line 4, execution is yielded to the block (or the block is called), and we're passing number + 1 to the block. This means we're calling the block with 6 as the block argument.
      - Execution jumps to line 10, where the block local variable num is assigned 6.
      - Execution continues to line 11, where we output the block local variable num.
      - Execution continues to line 12, where the end of the block is reached.
      - Execution now jumps back to the method implementation, where we just finished executing line 4.
      - Execution continues to line #5, the end of the if.
      - Line 6 returns the value of the incremented argument to line 10.
      - The program ends (the return value of #increment is not used)

   5. Return value of yielding to the block

      1. they have a return value, and that return value is determined based on the last expression in the block
      2. This implies that just like normal methods, blocks can either mutate the argument with a destructive method call or the block can return a value.

4. The number of arguments

   1. Method
      1. The number of arguments at method invocation needs to match the method definition, regardless of whether we are passing in a block. The number of passed in arguments and the number of arguments that be defined in the method definition has to be strictly match.
      2. Every method can take an optional block as an implicit parameter. Every method, regardless of its definition, takes an implicit block. It may ignore the implicit block, but it still accepts it.
   2. Block
      1. The rules regarding the number of arguments that you can pass to a block, Proc, or lambda in Ruby is called its *arity*. In Ruby, blocks have lenient arity rules, which is why it doesn't complain when you pass in different number of arguments. It means that blocks don't enforce argument count, unlike normal methods in Ruby.

5. When we want to use blocks

   1. Defer some implementation code to method invocation decision.
      1. There are times when the method implementor is not 100% certain of how the method will be called. Maybe the method implementor is 90% certain, but wants to leave that 10% decision up to the method caller at method invocation time.
      2. If you encounter a scenario where you're calling a method from multiple places, with one little tweak in each case, it may be a good idea to try implementing the method in a generic way by yielding to a block.
      3. If your method implementation contains a `yield`, a developer using your method can come in after this method is fully implemented and inject additional code in the middle of this method (without modifying the method implementation), by passing in a block of code. This is indeed one of the major use cases of using blocks, which we'll talk more about later.
   2. Methods that need to perform some "before" and "after" actions - sandwich code.
      1. Timing, logging, notification systems are all examples where before/after actions are important.
      
         ```ruby
         def time_it
           time_before = Time.now
           yield                       # execute the implicit block
           time_after= Time.now
         
           puts "It took #{time_after - time_before} seconds."
         end
         
         time_it { sleep(3) }                    # It took 3.003767 seconds.
                                                 # => nil
         
         time_it { "hello world" }               # It took 3.0e-06 seconds.
                                                 # => nil
         ```
      
      2. Another area where before/after actions are important is in resource management, or interfacing with the operating system.

6. Methods with an explicit block parameter

   1. We define a method to take an explicit block by defining a parameter prefixed by an `&` character in the method definition:

   ```ruby
   def test(&block)
     puts "What's &block? #{block}"
   end
   
   test { sleep(1) }
   
   # What's &block? #<Proc:0x007f98e32b83c8@(irb):59>
   # => nil
   ```

   - The `&block` is a special parameter that converts the block argument to what we call a "simple" `Proc` object (the exact definition of a simple `Proc` object isn't important at this time). Notice that we drop the `&` when referring to the parameter inside the method.
   - As you can see, the block local variable is now a Proc object. Note that we can name it whatever we please; it doesn't have to be block, just as long as we define it with a leading `&`.

   ```ruby
   def test2(block)
     puts "hello"
     block.call                    # calls the block that was originally passed to test()
     puts "good-bye"
   end
   
   def test(&block)
     puts "1"
     test2(block)
     puts "2"
   end
   
   test { puts "xyz" }
   # => 1
   # => hello
   # => xyz
   # => good-bye
   # => 2
   ```

   - Note that you only need to use `&` for the block parameter in `#test`. Since `block` is already a `Proc` object when we call `test2`, no conversion is needed.
   - Note that we also use `block.call` inside test2 to invoke the `Proc` instead of yield. (If you wanted to invoke the `Proc` from `test`, you would do the same thing: `block.call`.)
   - For now, you just need to know **that Ruby converts `blocks` passed in as explicit blocks to a simple `Proc` object** (this is why we need to use `#call` to invoke the `Proc` object).

7. Code explanation

   ```ruby
   # method implementation
   def times(number)
     counter = 0
     while counter < number do
       yield(counter)
       counter += 1
     end
   
     number                      # return the original method argument to match behavior of `Integer#times`
   end
   
   # method invocation
   times(5) do |num|
     puts num
   end
   
   # Output:
   # 0
   # 1
   # 2
   # 3
   # 4
   # => 5
   ```

   1. Method invocation starts at line 13, when the `times` method is called with an argument, `5`, and a block of code.
   2. Execution enters the first line of the method implementation at line 3, where the local variable `counter` is initialized.
   3. Execution continues to line 4. The `while` conditional is evaluated. The first time through, the condition is true.
   4. Execution continues to line 5, which yields to the block. This is the same as executing the block of code, and this time, we are executing the block of code with an argument. The argument to the block is the `counter`, which is `0` the first time through.
   5. Execution jumps to the block on line 13, setting `counter` to the block local variable `num`.
   6. Execution continues in the block to line 14, which outputs the block local variable `num`.
   7. Reaching the end of the block, execution continues back to the `times` method implementation on line 6, where the `counter` is incremented.
   8. Reaching the end of the `while` loop, execution continues on line 4, essentially repeating steps 3 through 7.
   9. At some point, the `while` conditional should return false (otherwise, you have an infinite loop), allowing execution to flow to line 9, which doesn't do anything.
   10. Reaching the end of the method at line 10, execution will return the last expression in this method, which is the `number` local variable.

8. Blocks and Variable Scope

   1. ```ruby
      def call_me(some_code)
        some_code.call            # call will execute the "chunk of code" that gets passed in
      end
      
      name = "Robert"
      chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}
      
      call_me(chunk_of_code)
      
      # hi Robert
      # => nil
      ```

   2. ```ruby
      def call_me(some_code)
        some_code.call
      end
      
      name = "Robert"
      chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}
      name = "Griffin III"        # re-assign name after Proc initialization
      
      call_me(chunk_of_code)
      
      # hi Griffin III
      # => nil
      ```

      - So even re-assigning the variable after the Proc is initialized updates the `chunk_of_code`. 
      - In order for this "chunk of code" to be executed later, it must understand the surrounding context from when it was initialized. In Ruby, this "chunk of code" or closure is represented by a `Proc` object, a `lambda`, or a `block`. Remember that `blocks` are a form of `Proc`.
      - This implies that the Proc keeps track of its surrounding context, and drags it around wherever the chunk of code is passed to. In Ruby, we call this its **binding**, or surrounding environment/context. 
      - **A closure must keep track of its surrounding context in order to have all the information it needs in order to be executed later.**
      - **This not only includes local variables, but also method references, constants and other artifacts in your code -- whatever it needs to execute correctly, it will drag all of it around.**
   - This is at the core of variable scoping rules in Ruby, and it's why "inner scopes can access outer scopes".
     
   3. ```ruby
      def call_me(some_code)
        some_code.call
      end
      
      chunk_of_code = Proc.new {puts "hi #{name}"}
      name = "Griffin III"        # re-assign name after Proc initialization
      
      call_me(chunk_of_code)
      
      # undefined local variable or method `name' for main:Object (NameError) in solution.rb (block in <main>)
      ```

   4. ```ruby
      def call_me
        yield
      end
      
      name = "Robert"
      call_me {puts "hi #{name}"}
      
      # hi Robert
      ```

   5. ```ruby
      name1 = "Robert"
      name = "Alice"
      chunk_of_code = Proc.new { |name| puts "hi #{name1}, and hi #{name}"}
      
      chunk_of_code.call
      
      # hi Robert, and hi 
      ```

9. the use of & with explicit blocks (&:to_s)

   1. 

      ```ruby
      ["hello", "world"].each(&:upcase!)   # => ["HELLO", "WORLD"]
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].select(&:odd?)       # => [1, 3, 5]
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].select(&:odd?).any?(&:even?) # => false
      ```

      -  When working with collections, we often want to transform all items in that collection. We could write the code like above shortcut.
      - Note that the `&` must be followed by a `symbol` name for a method that can be invoked on each element.
      - Unfortunately, we can't use the shortcut to do it If the method needs to take arguments.

   2. What behind this `&`

      1. Ruby checks whether the object after `&` is a `Proc`. If it is, it uses the object as-is. 
      2. Otherwise, it tries to call `#to_proc` on the object, which should return a `Proc` object. An error will occur if the `#to_proc` fails to return a `Proc` object.
      3. If all is well, the & turns the Proc into a block.

   3. For the `&:to_s` example:

      1. This means that Ruby is trying to turn `:to_s` into a block. However, it's not a Proc; it's a Symbol. Ruby will then try to call the `Symbol#to_proc` method -- and there is one! This method will return a `Proc` object, which will execute the method based on the name of the symbol. In other words, `Symbol#to_proc` returns a `Proc`, which `&` turns into a block, which turns our shortcut into the long form block usage.

      2. ```ruby
         def my_method
           yield(2)
         end
         
         # turns the symbol into a Proc, then & turns the Proc into a block
         my_method(&:to_s)               # => "2"
         ```

      3. The code example below will try to break up the 2 steps

         ```ruby
         def my_method
           yield(2)
         end
         
         a_proc = :to_s.to_proc          # explicitly call to_proc on the symbol
         my_method(&a_proc)              # convert Proc into block, then pass block in. Returns "2"
         ```

       end
       
       # method invocation
       times(5) do |num|
         puts num

         array                                             # returns the `array` parameter, similar in spirit to how `Array#each` returns the caller

20. Vocabulary in Testing

    1. **Test Suite:** this is the entire set of tests that accompanies your program or application. You can think of this as *all the tests* for a project.
    2. **Test:** this describes a situation or context in which tests are run. For example, this test is about making sure you get an error message after trying to log in with the wrong password. A test can contain multiple assertions.
    3. **Assertion:** this is the actual verification step to confirm that the data returned by your program or application is indeed what is expected. You make one or more assertions within a test.

21. test methods mentioned in the course

    2. | Assertion                          | Description                                 |
       | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
       | `assert(test)`                     | Fails unless `test` is truthy.              |
       | `assert_equal(exp, act)`           | Fails unless `exp == act`.                  |
       | `assert_nil(obj)`                  | Fails unless `obj` is `nil`.                |
       | `assert_raises(*exp) { ... }`      | Fails unless block raises one of `*exp`.    |
       | `assert_instance_of(cls, obj)`     | Fails unless `obj` is an instance of `cls`. |
       | `assert_includes(collection, obj)` | Fails unless `collection` includes `obj`.   |

22. SEAT Approach

    1. Set up the necessary objects. (#setup)
    2. Execute the code against the object we're testing.
    3. Assert the results of the execution.
    4. Tear down and clean up any lingering artifacts. (#teardown)

23. The difference between `assert_equal` and `assert_same`

24. Code Coverage

    1. Note that even though we are only testing public code, code coverage is based on all of your code, both public and private. 
    2. Also, this doesn't mean every edge case is considered, or that even our program is working correctly. 
    3. It only means that we have some tests in place for every method.

       $ rvm --ruby-version default
       ```

26. Bundler

    1. `gem install bundler`

    2. Bundler relies on a file named Gemfile to tell it which version of Ruby and its Gems it should use.

       1. ```ruby
          source 'https://rubygems.org'
          
          ruby '2.3.1'
          gem 'sinatra'
          gem 'erubis'
          gem 'rack'
          gem 'rake', '~>10.4.0'
          ```

    3. `bundle install`

    4. will create a `Gemfile.lock` file

    5. add `require 'bundler/setup'` to the beginning of your app, before any other Gems.

27. Set Up a Project

    1. Create a remote repo on Github

    2. Create a directory on local filesystem

    3. Run the commands from the "...or create a new repository..."

    4. Add appropriate files

    5. Git commit & git push

    6. Configure Bundler

       1. Gemfile

          1. `source 'https://rubygems.org'`

          2. indicate Ruby version

          3. decide which Gems your program needs

          4. a sample `Gemfile`

             1. ```ruby
                source 'https://rubygems.org'
                
                ruby '2.5.0'
                
                gem 'minitest', '~> 5.10'
                gem 'minitest-reporters', '~> 1.1'
                ```

       2. Tell RVM to use Ruby 2.5.0 by using `rvm use 2.5.0`
          ```ruby
          $ rvm install ruby-2.5.0
          $ rvm use 2.5.0
          $ gem install bundler
          ```

       3. `bundle install`

       4. We must tell each Ruby program in our project to use Bundler

          1. `require 'bundler/setup'`
          2. You must require bundler/setup before any other require statements.

28. to add a gem

    1. modify out code to require the gem in our main program
       1. add `require 'stamp' ` in main program
       2. modify your code to use the gem
       3. run the code or test, then find out that cannot find the method or gem
       4. add gem statement in Gemfile
       5. Run `bundle install` to rebuild the `Gemfile.lock` file

29. Rake

    1. This is also a gem, need to add it in `Gemfile`
    2. add `gem 'rake'` in Gemfile, run `bundle install`
    3. can run this command to see which method you could run in `rake`
       1. `bundle exec rake -T`
       2. `bundle exec rake hello`

30. Preparing A Rubygem

    1. Read Doc
    2. Prepare directories
    3. Prepare `README.md` file
    4. Write Doc
    5. Prepare `[project-name].gemspec` file
    6. Add `gemspec` statement in `Gemfile`
    7. Modify `Rakefile` 
       1. `require "bundler/gem_tasks"`
