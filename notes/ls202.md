1. The **type** selector has the lowest specificity weight and holds a point value of `0-0-1`. The **class** selector has a medium specificity weight and holds a point value of `0-1-0`. Lastly, the **ID** selector has a high specificity weight and holds a point value of `1-0-0`.

2. The higher the specificity weight of a selector, the more superiority the selector is given when a styling conflict occurs. For example, if a paragraph element is selected using a type selector in one place and an ID selector in another, the ID selector will take precedence over the type selector regardless of where the ID selector appears in the cascade.

   1. ```html
      <p id="food">...</p>
      ```

   2. ```css
      #food {
        background: green;
      }
      p {
        background: orange;
      }
      ```

   3. consequently the paragraph will appear with a `green` background.
